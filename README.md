## Contribute

Contributions are very welcome!

For bug fixes you can open pull requests right away, but for improvements and new features I'd suggest opening an issue for discussion first to avoid unnecessary work if it gets rejected.

When you commit code please use prefixes according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [@commitlint/config-conventional](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventiona) to make [changelogithub](https://github.com/antfu/changelogithub) work properly.
